# Graham Jantz Portfolio

I rebuilt my online portfolio using React skills I have gained over the last month. I used components to render the different "pages". The nav buttons trigger loading a different component into the main window. I believe this has increased the speed of my site.

I have started implementing styled components as well, starting with the theme switch in the footer. I have plans to implement styling into all the components to simplify the code overall.
